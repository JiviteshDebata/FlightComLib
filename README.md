# FlightComLib
A Fast Low Level Flight Controller Communications Library

### Design Principles
  #### 1. Light Weight - Should be independant from 3rd party libraries or any middleware(as much as possible)
  #### 2. Maximum Protocol Support -Should interact with MultiWii based Flight Controllers (MSPV1 and MSPV2, Mavlink(v1 and v2) etc.
  #### 3. Cross Platform - Using Native APIs to run on Windows , Linux or other Distros
  
### Goals
  #### 1. Create a universal Library for debugging and controlling multiple flight control devices.
  #### 2. Make Library Easy to integrate into any project
